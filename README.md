# 🚀 NeetCode Roadmap Solutions (C++/JS)

## Project Overview

This repository is dedicated to intensive Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) training over a 5-month period, focused on brushing up the fundamentals.

The core training plan involves solving problems based on the popular **NeetCode roadmap** to cover fundamental algorithms and key LeetCode questions.

* **Primary Focus:** Algorithms and Data Structures.
* **Duration:** 5 Months
* **Daily Goal:** 2 Problems per Day

## 💻 Language Strategy

Given my background as a Frontend Engineer with strong C++ experience, the following language strategy is employed:

| Phase | Goal | Language | Reasoning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Preparation** | Maximize speed and focus on algorithms. | **C++** | Leverage deep C++ experience and its emphasis on complexity/efficiency. |
| **Interview** | Code in the most comfortable daily language. | **JavaScript** | Use as the primary language for coding during the actual interview. |

All solutions are primarily implemented in C++ to capture the optimal, most efficient approach.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Solutions are organized to mirror the NeetCode roadmap sections for easy navigation and focused review.

| Directory | Content |
| :--- | :--- |
| `C++/` | All working solutions coded in C++. |
| `JavaScript/` | (Optional) Folder for practicing interview transcription or specific JS solutions. |

### NeetCode Roadmap Categories

Each folder under `C++/` corresponds to a roadmap section:

1.  `01-Arrays-and-Hashing/`
2.  `02-Two-Pointers/`
3.  `03-Sliding-Window/`
4.  `04-Stack/`
5.  `05-Binary-Search/`
6.  `06-Linked-List/`
7.  `07-Trees/`
8.  `08-Tries/`
9.  `09-Heap-and-Priority-Queue/`
10. `10-Graphs/`
11. `11-Advanced-Graphs/`
12. `12-Dynamic-Programming/`
13. `13-Bit-Manipulation/`

## ✅ Solution Standards

Every solution file adheres to a strict standard for maintainability and to enforce analytical discipline:

* **Header Documentation:** Each file includes comments detailing the problem source, approach, and complexity analysis.
* **Time Complexity ($O(T)$):** Must be calculated and noted.
* **Space Complexity ($O(S)$):** Must be calculated and noted.

**Example File Header:**

```cpp
// ------------------------------------
// LeetCode Problem: [Problem Title]
// Link: [Full Problem URL]
// Date: YYYY-MM-DD
// ------------------------------------

// Approach: [Specific technique used, e.g., "Depth First Search (DFS) with Memoization"]
// Time Complexity: O(T)
// Space Complexity: O(S)
// ... solution code ...
